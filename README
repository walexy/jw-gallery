JW-Gallery

Creates a simple video playlist for the JW Player for HTML5
from a JSON feed.

* fast and lightweight
* Fullscreen support for webkit
* Full window support for non-webkit browsers
* RTMP support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The JW Player for HTML5 is still in beta and does not
support full screen or full window support. To enable the
full screen/window feature and RTMP support you'll have to
modify jquery.jwplayer.js as in the example.

Once JW Player for HTML5 emerges from Beta my own jw-gallery
script will become a relic. In the meantime, enjoy and learn!

For simple styling the example uses Nathan Smith's popular
960.gs framework documented at http://960.gs.

The previous/next and scrolling features are enabled through
jquery.scrollTo.js
